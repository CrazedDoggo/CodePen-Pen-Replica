# Codepen-Pen-Replica
This replica was created via CSS Grid, taught by Wes Bos' course at https://cssgrid.io/. 

This code was written in advance before the instructor reached it to allow me to view any mistakes and make changes accordingly. No modifications or custom markup was written with only a few initial styles for font sizes and families being provided. No flexbox was used, only grid.

It was firstly made by creating the initial layout of the webpage, with the header and footer taking all needed space (auto) and the code and iframe sections taking up the remaining space via a 1 fr unit. Afterwards, the header and code sections were also given their own grid layouts.

The exact styling of text came after the formatting was done. All colors were directly retrieved from https://codepen.io/.
